            Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.
            
            Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.
            
            Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.

        <li>Start making the sauce:
            Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.
